# Elephantine Language Reference Sheet

---

## Introduction

The Elephantine Language is a constructed language inspired by the natural vocalizations of elephants. It imagines how elephants might communicate if their sounds formed a structured language akin to human languages. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the Elephantine Language's rules and structures for learners with no prior experience.

## Phonology

In the Elephantine Language, the diverse sounds produced by elephants serve as phonemes—the basic units of sound that distinguish meaning.

### Phonemes and Their Characteristics

1. **Trumpets (`T`)**
   - **Description**: Loud, resonant calls produced with the trunk.
   - **Characteristics**: Variable in pitch and duration; can be long or short.

2. **Rumbles (`R`)**
   - **Description**: Low-frequency sounds that can travel long distances.
   - **Characteristics**: Sustained, low-frequency vibrations; pitch can vary.

3. **Snorts (`S`)**
   - **Description**: Short, explosive exhalations through the trunk.
   - **Characteristics**: Brief and percussive; pitch variation possible.

4. **Squeaks (`Q`)**
   - **Description**: High-pitched sounds, often brief.
   - **Characteristics**: Can be rapidly repeated; pitch varies.

5. **Chirps (`C`)**
   - **Description**: Short, melodic sounds.
   - **Characteristics**: Light, staccato notes; pitch variation possible.

6. **Growls (`G`)**
   - **Description**: Deep, throaty sounds.
   - **Characteristics**: Rough and medium in duration; pitch can vary.

7. **Barks (`B`)**
   - **Description**: Sharp, abrupt vocalizations.
   - **Characteristics**: Sudden and short; pitch variation allowed.

8. **Roars (`O`)**
   - **Description**: Powerful, prolonged sounds.
   - **Characteristics**: Extended and forceful; pitch variation present.

**Note on Pitch Variation:** All phonemes in the Elephantine Language can vary in pitch. Pitch variation is crucial and conveys grammatical meanings such as tense, aspect, and mood. This variation is universally applied to all phonemes, including those considered consonants.

## Phonotactics and Syllable Structure

**Phonotactics** refers to the rules governing permissible combinations of sounds.

### Syllable Structure

The basic syllable structure is **(C)V(C)**:
- **C** = Consonant (any phoneme)
- **V** = Vowel (Rumbles `R` and Roars `O` function as vowels due to their sustained nature)

**Consonant-only syllables** are allowed, especially in root words and particles.

#### Syllable Examples

- **Open syllable (CV)**: `T` + `R` (Trumpet followed by Rumble)
- **Closed syllable (CVC)**: `S` + `O` + `G` (Snort, Roar, Growl)
- **Consonant-only syllable (C)**: `B` (Bark)

### Phonotactic Rules

1. **Consonant Clusters**: Maximum of two consonants can appear consecutively.
2. **Vowel Lengthening**: Rumbles `R` and Roars `O` can be lengthened to convey emphasis or intensity.
3. **Pitch Variation**: Changes in pitch on any phoneme modify grammatical meanings like tense and mood.

## Morphology

**Morphology** deals with the formation and structure of words.

### Word Formation

Words are formed using **roots** and **affixes**.

#### Roots

- Represent basic concepts.
- Examples:
  - **Water**: `R` (Rumble)
  - **Food**: `O` (Roar)
  - **Drink**: `B` (Bark)

#### Affixes

Modify or extend the meaning of roots.

**Prefixes:**

- **Intensifier (`S`)**: Adds emphasis.
  - *Example*: `S` + `R` (Snort-Rumble) means "much water."
- **Negation (`G`)**: Indicates negation or opposition.
  - *Example*: `G` + `R` (Growl-Rumble) means "no water."

**Suffixes:**

- **Plurality (`Q`)**: Indicates plural forms.
  - *Example*: `R` + `Q` (Rumble-Squeak) means "waters."
- **Diminutive (`C`)**: Denotes smallness or endearment.
  - *Example*: `R` + `C` (Rumble-Chirp) means "little water."

## Syntax

**Syntax** defines how words are arranged in sentences.

### Sentence Structure

The Elephantine Language follows a **Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)** order.

#### Components

1. **Subject**: Performer of the action.
2. **Object**: Recipient of the action.
3. **Verb**: The action itself.

#### Example

- **"Elephant drinks water":**
  - **Subject**: `T` (Trumpet) for "Elephant"
  - **Object**: `R` (Rumble) for "Water"
  - **Verb**: `B` (Bark) for "Drinks"
  - **Constructed Sentence**: `T` `R` `B` (Trumpet Rumble Bark)

---

## Grammar

Grammar encompasses tense, aspect, mood, and the use of pronouns.

### Tense

Indicated by **pitch variation** on the verb's primary phoneme (universal to all phonemes including consonants).

- **Present Tense**: Normal pitch.
- **Past Tense**: Lowered pitch.
- **Future Tense**: Raised pitch.

#### Example with Verb "Walk" (`S`):

- **Present**: Normal pitch on `S`.
- **Past**: Lower pitch on `S`.
- **Future**: Higher pitch on `S`.

### Aspect

Conveys the nature of the action.

- **Continuous Aspect**: Repeat the verb's primary phoneme.
  - *Example*: `B` `B` (Repeated Bark) for "is drinking."
- **Perfect Aspect**: Prefix the verb with `Q` (Squeak).
  - *Example*: `Q` `B` (Squeak-Bark) for "has drunk."

### Mood

Expresses the speaker's intent or attitude.

- **Indicative Mood**: Standard statements.
- **Imperative Mood**: Begin the sentence with `B` (Bark).
  - *Example*: `B` `TOG` (Bark Trumpet-Roar-Growl) for "Run!"
- **Interrogative Mood**: End the sentence with a higher-pitched `Q` (Squeak).
  - *Example*: `TO` `Q` (Trumpet-Roar Squeak with higher pitch) for "Is there danger?"

## Pronouns

Personal pronouns are represented by specific phonemes, with plurality indicated by adding a Squeak (`Q`).

### Singular Pronouns

- **First Person ("I")**: `T` (Trumpet)
- **Second Person ("You")**: `S` (Snort)
- **Third Person ("He/She/It")**: `G` (Growl)

### Plural Pronouns

- **First Person ("We")**: `TQ` (Trumpet-Squeak)
- **Second Person ("You all")**: `SQ` (Snort-Squeak)
- **Third Person ("They")**: `GQ` (Growl-Squeak)
