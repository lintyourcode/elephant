# Elephantine Language Reference Sheet

**Introduction**

The Elephantine Language is a constructed language (conlang) designed exclusively using the vocalizations that elephants produce. It aims to simulate how elephants might communicate if their sounds formed a structured language similar to human languages. This reference sheet provides all the rules and structures of the Elephantine Language for learners with no prior experience.

## Phonology

Elephants produce a variety of sounds, each with distinct acoustic properties. In the Elephantine Language, these sounds serve as the fundamental phonemes (distinct units of sound).

### Phonemes

1. **Trumpets** (`T`): Loud, resonant calls produced with the trunk.
2. **Rumbles** (`R`): Low-frequency sounds that can travel long distances.
3. **Snorts** (`S`): Short, explosive exhalations through the trunk.
4. **Squeaks** (`Q`): High-pitched sounds, often brief.
5. **Chirps** (`C`): Short, melodic sounds similar to bird chirps.
6. **Growls** (`G`): Deep, throaty sounds.
7. **Barks** (`B`): Sharp, abrupt vocalizations.
8. **Roars** (`O`): Powerful, prolonged sounds.

### Phoneme Characteristics

- **Trumpets (`T`)**: Long or short, variable in pitch.
- **Rumbles (`R`)**: Continuous, low-frequency; can be sustained.
- **Snorts (`S`)**: Brief, percussive.
- **Squeaks (`Q`)**: High-pitched, can be repeated rapidly.
- **Chirps (`C`)**: Light, staccato.
- **Growls (`G`)**: Rough texture, medium duration.
- **Barks (`B`)**: Sudden onset, short duration.
- **Roars (`O`)**: Extended duration, forceful.

## Syllable Structure

The basic syllable structure in the Elephantine Language is (C)V(C), where:

- `C` = Consonant (any phoneme except rumbles and roars)
- `V` = Vowel (rumbles `R` and roars `O` serve as vowels due to their sustained nature)

### Possible Syllable Examples

- **Open syllable (CV)**: `T` + `R` (Trumpet followed by Rumble)
- **Closed syllable (CVC)**: `S` + `O` + `G` (Snort, Roar, Growl)
- **Vowel-only syllable (V)**: `R` or `O`

---

## Phonotactics

Rules governing sound combinations:

1. **Consonant Clusters**: A maximum of two consonants can appear consecutively.
2. **Vowel Length**: Rumbles and roars can be short or long to convey different meanings.
3. **Tone and Pitch**: Variations in pitch can modify meaning (e.g., a higher pitch might indicate a question).

## Morphology

### Word Formation

- **Roots**: Basic concepts are represented by root syllables.
- **Affixes**: Modify roots to change meaning.

#### Prefixes

- **Intensifier (`S`)**: Snort added before a root to intensify meaning.
- **Negation (`G`)**: Growl prefix indicates negation.

#### Suffixes

- **Plurality (`Q`)**: Squeak added after a root to indicate plural.
- **Diminutive (`C`)**: Chirp suffix denotes smallness or endearment.

### Examples

- **Root word for "water"**: `R` (Rumble)
  - **"Much water"**: `S` + `R` (Snort-Rumble)
  - **"No water"**: `G` + `R` (Growl-Rumble)
  - **"Waters"**: `R` + `Q` (Rumble-Squeak)
  - **"Little water"**: `R` + `C` (Rumble-Chirp)

---

## Syntax

Elephantine Language follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order.

### Sentence Structure

1. **Subject**: The doer of the action.
2. **Object**: The receiver of the action.
3. **Verb**: The action itself.

### Example Sentence

- **"Elephant drinks water":**
  - **Subject (Elephant)**: `T` (Trumpet)
  - **Object (Water)**: `R` (Rumble)
  - **Verb (Drinks)**: `B` (Bark)
  - **Constructed Sentence**: `T` `R` `B` (Trumpet Rumble Bark)

---

## Grammar

### Tense

Tense is indicated by pitch variation of the vowel sounds (`R` and `O`):

- **Present Tense**: Normal pitch.
- **Past Tense**: Lowered pitch.
- **Future Tense**: Raised pitch.

### Aspect

Aspect is shown by repeating the vowel sound:

- **Continuous Aspect**: Double the vowel sound.
  - E.g., `R` `R` (Sustained Rumble) for ongoing action.
- **Perfect Aspect**: Precede the verb with a `Q` (Squeak).
  - E.g., `Q` `B` (Squeak-Bark) for "has drunk."

### Mood

Mood is expressed through the use of specific phonemes:

- **Indicative Mood**: Standard sentence structure.
- **Imperative Mood**: Begin with `B` (Bark).
- **Interrogative Mood**: End with a higher-pitched `Q` (Squeak).

---

## Pronouns

Personal pronouns are represented by specific sounds:

- **First Person Singular ("I")**: `T` (Trumpet)
- **Second Person Singular ("You")**: `S` (Snort)
- **Third Person Singular ("He/She/It")**: `G` (Growl)

Plurality is indicated by adding `Q` (Squeak):

- **First Person Plural ("We")**: `T` + `Q` (Trumpet-Squeak)
- **Second Person Plural ("You all")**: `S` + `Q` (Snort-Squeak)
- **Third Person Plural ("They")**: `G` + `Q` (Growl-Squeak)

## Vocabulary

Here is a basic vocabulary list of common words:

- **Elephant**: `T` (Trumpet)
- **Water**: `R` (Rumble)
- **Food**: `O` (Roar)
- **Tree**: `G` (Growl)
- **Drink**: `B` (Bark)
- **Eat**: `C` (Chirp)
- **Walk**: `S` (Snort)
- **Big**: `O` (Roar)
- **Small**: `C` (Chirp)
- **Danger**: `T` + `O` (Trumpet-Roar)
- **Friend**: `R` + `C` (Rumble-Chirp)
- **Hurry**: `TOS` (Trumpet-Roar-Snort)
- **Run**: `TON` (Trumpet-Roar-Growl)

---

## Examples

### Example 1: "We eat food."

- **Subject ("We")**: `TQ` (Trumpet-Squeak)
- **Object ("Food")**: `O` (Roar)
- **Verb ("Eat")**: `C` (Chirp)
- **Constructed Sentence**: `TQ` `O` `C` (Trumpet-Squeak Roar Chirp)

### Example 2: "Is there danger?"

- **Object ("Danger")**: `TO` (Trumpet-Roar)
- **Interrogative Mood**: End with higher-pitched `Q` (Squeak)
- **Constructed Sentence**: `TOQ` (Trumpet-Roar-Squeak with higher pitch)

### Example 3: "They walked."

- **Subject ("They")**: `GQ` (Growl-Squeak)
- **Verb ("Walk")**: `S` (Snort)
- **Past Tense**: Lower pitch on the verb
- **Constructed Sentence**: `GQ` `S` (Growl-Squeak Snort with lowered pitch)

### Example 4: "Hurry!"

- **Imperative Mood**: Begin with `B` (Bark)
- **Verb ("Hurry")**: `TOS` (Trumpet-Roar-Snort)
- **Constructed Sentence**: `B` `TOS` (Bark Trumpet-Roar-Snort)

---

## Communication Nuances

### Emphasis

Emphasis can be added by increasing the volume or duration of a sound.

- **Emphasizing a word**: Prolong the vowel or consonant.
  - E.g., Lengthen `R` in `R` (Rumble) to emphasize "water."

### Emotional Tone

Emotions are conveyed through modifications in sound quality:

- **Happiness**: Upward pitch glides.
- **Sadness**: Downward pitch glides.
- **Urgency**: Increased tempo of sounds.
- **Calmness**: Slower tempo and smoother transitions.

## Summary

The Elephantine Language uses the natural sounds produced by elephants as phonemes to form a structured language with its own phonology, morphology, syntax, and grammar. By combining these sounds according to specific rules, complex ideas and sentences can be communicated effectively.
